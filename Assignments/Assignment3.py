#Q:1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
#A:1. Functions always helps to address the code outcome quickly. Any repetitive or reusable or complex code statement can be converted into the function which can be called multiple times in the
        #file to help the computation effecient.


#Q:2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?
#A:2. Code runs within the function when its called.


#Q:3. What statement creates a function?
#A:3. def statement creates a function


#Q:4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
#A:4. A function is a similar to a structured instructions we create to have the code perform/act in perticular way for the desired outcome. This can be a written steps that code will perform.
    #Function call is a statement used when we want the function to perform as and when required.


#Q:5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
#A:5. There is only one global python scope per program execution. Scope remains present until program terminates. There can be different pythin scope which contain names that we define inside the function.


#Q:6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
#A:6. Everytime we call the function it will create new local scope. Upon calling of a function it will hold the variable values as per the given inputs, and return the output.
        #At the end of the code execution it destroy the values which variable is holding.


#Q:7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?
#A:7. return statement will send the functions results/output back to the caller. Yes, it is possible to use return value in an expression.


#Q:8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
#A:8. If return value is not given to the function it will give no output when executed. It will return None.


#Q:9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?
#A:9. We will have to define the variable with the keyword global.


#Q:10. What is the data type of None?
#A:10. NoneType is the datatype of None. It means null or no value.


#Q:11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?
#A:11. This will import the library called "areallyourpetsnamederic".


#Q:12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?
#A:12. spam.bacon()


#Q:13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?
#A:13. We csn use error handling or exception handling to notify the user about the error.


#Q:14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?
#A.14. Try clause will execute the code mentioned after it. The except clause will be introduced if anything incorrect happens with the try clause.
